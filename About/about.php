    <h1 class="jumbo">About Hack n' Snacks </h1> 
    <p class="jumbotron">Hack n’ Snacks provides various meals of all kinds to consumers by the click of a few buttons! 
        They are easy to make, nutritious, and most definitely delicious. Hack n’ Snacks is looking to help the parents, 
        families, or anyone in general, who is struggling with the current pandemic we all are living through. We wanted to 
        create this easy, affordable, meal service that you can order online so that you can avoid the hassle of leaving the 
        house. We also were aware of parents and families having to feed their kids who were home from school. The meals we 
        wanted to sell were trying to be geared towards that very situation; to make it easier, quicker, and more affordable. 
        This was so, a parent working from home would not have to worry about not having lunch or dinner every single night.
